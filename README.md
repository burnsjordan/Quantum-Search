# Quantum Search
This repository is a collection of research about quantum search algorithms including relevant papers, problems, and code to simulate different quantum search algorithms.
## Relevant Papers
[Grover's Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043)  
[Grover's Description of how to get to his algorithm starting from the Schrodinger Equation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109116)  
[Paper on why the probability of measuring the state you want can go down after applying the gate more times.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605034)
## Relevant Problems
6.2 - [Inversion About Mean Operation]()  
6.9 - [U(t) Rotation on Bloch Sphere]()  
6.12 - [Alternative Hamiltonain for Qauntum Search]()
## Description of Included Code
[quantum_search.py](https://github.com/burnsjordan/Quantum-Search/blob/master/quantum_search.py) - Allows user to apply a hamiltonian to a specified initial state and output the results of measuring at a specific time for various number of applications of the gate.
